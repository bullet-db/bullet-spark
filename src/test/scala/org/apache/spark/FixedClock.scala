 * A `Clock` whose time can be manually set and modified. Its reported time does not change
 * as time elapses, but only as its time is modified by callers. This is mainly useful for
 * testing.
 *
 * Unfortunately, the Clock interface has a package protected visibility limited to the
 * org.apache.spark package. But we can workaround this by placing our own implementation
 * extending the interface in this same package.
